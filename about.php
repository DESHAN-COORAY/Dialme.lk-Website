			<p><b>W</b>ith the concept of globalization, the use of material money to meet every day human needs has reached its peak, In the face of global epidemics, it is unpredictable that man will gradually use coins and banknotes and walk the market to buy goods. Not only in the western countries which are at the forefront of technology but also in developing countries like Sri Lanka through the internet Very soon these tendencies can be seen to be replaced.

 At a time when even schooling cannot be done without the internet, a smartphone and a computer have become essential for almost every household. We all know that a smartphone can be used to do all the day to day activities more easily than a computer. Even going to the market to buy a smartphone is very risky. For some time now, phone ordering websites have been run by certain companies, but many of them have not been updated. Also, some websites do not even list the basic technical features of the phones. After studying these issues, we introduce 'Dialme.LK' as our group project that can be easily used by the customer and easily updated by the business.</p>
